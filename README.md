# First order plus time delay 
(using Least Square Method and Sustained Oscillation)

*************************************************************************
  Before running the following codes, you need to run the simulink       
  firstly. Then the step response data of the process can be obtained.   
                                                                         
  Step 1: Clear all                                                      
  Step 2: Run originalProcess.slx                                        
  Step 3: Run pcAssign1.m                                                
  Step 4: Run resultsTesting.slx                                         
  ( you can also test the Nyquist results by nyquistTest.m )
